# Programming

- it is a workspace while I am preparing for interviews
- this workspace contains pre-written tasks for **debugging**, **running** c++ files,and **cleaning** output files files quickly from vscode

#### before using this workspace
- if you want to clone and use this workspace you have to follow steps:
	- change c++ compiler in `.vscode/tasks.json`, I used gcc compiler on mac and set path according to that, you can set path to c++ compiler according to your system.

#### how to run a particular file
- open the c++ file you want to run **(file must be open)** in order run that file
- press `command/control + shift + P` type `run build task` press enter to run the task.

#### clean workspace
- if you can run bash files from your system run `bash clean.sh` to remove unwanted build files and directories.
